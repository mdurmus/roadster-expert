# Roadster Expert - Introduction

Roadster Expert website is a Full Stack web application built on the Django Framework using the Python language as its foundation. The main purpose of this site is to provide a platform where users can share their experiences, opinions, or expertise regarding Roadster-type vehicles, either with experts or among themselves. Registered users can comment on and like posts, as well as share their experiences with the vehicles they have had the opportunity to use. Non-registered users can access the content and benefit from the information available on the site.
